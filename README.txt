A custom tool I built to generate geofence mutations for the Mobile game Hover. 

The tool enables user(me) to draw a geofence on a map and  translate the coordinate into a GraphQL mutation.
Geofences can be both polygons or circles, and the user can add name, descriptin and category, see screenshot. 

The tool can be found here: https://home.samfundet.no/~sirmy/geofencing/

The geofences appear in the Hover app when geofence is inserted in DB.
